GAze-based engagement dataset
The GABE dataset is a public collection of gaze-based engagement and mind wangdering data intended for research.

Why was this dataset created?
Historically, scientific research on engagement has been conducted on predominately white sample populations. This dataset aims to expand publicly available data on this topic and to be racially diverse.

What are engagement and mind wandering?
Engagement is important to learning (cite). Mind wandering can be considered a type of thought in which an individual is not engaged in the current task. Mind wandering is a complex construct that has been found to be associated with some negative outcomes, like x y z, and also plenty of positive ones, such as x y z.

How is gaze-based engagement data collected?
Participants work on a task while an eye tracker records their gaze coordinates. Throughout the task, they'll be periodically asked whether or not they are thinking about the task. These responses can then serve as ground truth that can be mapped to the gaze patterns that occurred around the same time.
